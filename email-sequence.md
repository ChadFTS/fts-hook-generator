## Email 1: Welcome + Swipe File Delivery
**Subject:** Your 50+ Hook Templates Are Here 🎣
**Send:** Immediately

You just unlocked the good stuff.

Here's your **Viral Hook Swipe File** with 50+ proven templates:

👉 [Download the Swipe File](https://hook-generator-beta.vercel.app/swipe-file.html)

**Quick tips to get the most from it:**

1. **Don't just copy — adapt.** Fill in the [brackets] with YOUR specific details
2. **Test 2-3 variations.** What works for fitness won't work the same for finance
3. **Stack formulas.** Combine a number hook with a curiosity gap for extra punch

Here's an example:

❌ Generic: "Here's how to grow on LinkedIn"

✅ With formula: "I went from 200 to 50,000 followers in 6 months. Here's the exact playbook (steal it)."

See the difference? Same topic. Wildly different engagement.

Tomorrow I'll share the #1 mistake I see people make with hooks (and how to fix it).

Talk soon,
Chad

## Email 2: The Hook Mistake
**Subject:** The #1 hook mistake (costs you 90% of views)
**Send:** Day 2

---

Here's the brutal truth about hooks:

**You have 1-2 seconds.** That's it.

Most people lose their audience in that window because they make this mistake:

**They start with context instead of curiosity.**

❌ "So I've been thinking about content marketing lately, and there's something I want to share with you about what I've learned over the years..."

Nobody's sticking around for that.

✅ "90% of your content is invisible. Here's why."

BOOM. Now they need to know.

**The fix is simple:**

Delete your first sentence. Seriously. Whatever you wrote first is probably throat-clearing. The real hook is hiding in sentence 2 or 3.

Try it on your next post. You'll be shocked how much better it performs.

Tomorrow: I'll share a case study of hooks that generated millions of views (with the exact formulas broken down).

## Email 3: Case Study - Hooks That Went Viral
**Subject:** These hooks got 70M+ views (breakdown inside)
**Send:** Day 4

---

Let me show you what works in the real world.

Our team has generated **70M+ views** for CEOs and founders. Here are 3 hooks that crushed it — and WHY they worked:

---

**Hook #1: The Contrarian**
*"Unpopular opinion: Most LinkedIn advice is garbage."*

**Why it worked:** Challenges the status quo. People who agree want to see validation. People who disagree want to argue. Either way — they engage.

**Formula:** "Unpopular opinion: [contrarian statement about your industry]"

---

**Hook #2: The Specific Number**
*"I built a 7-figure business with 3 employees. Here's how."*

**Why it worked:** Specificity = credibility. "7-figure" and "3 employees" create intrigue. How is that possible?

**Formula:** "I [achieved specific result] with [surprisingly small resource]. Here's how."

---

**Hook #3: The Open Loop**
*"Nobody talks about the dark side of entrepreneurship. Let me explain."*

**Why it worked:** Creates a curiosity gap. What's the dark side? They HAVE to find out.

**Formula:** "Nobody talks about [hidden aspect of topic]. Let me explain."

---

Notice the pattern?

Every winning hook does ONE thing: **makes the next line irresistible.**

That's it. That's the game.

Tomorrow: The system we use to turn ONE recording into 120+ pieces of content (without burning out).

## Email 4: The Content Multiplication Framework
**Subject:** How we create 120+ pieces from 1 recording
**Send:** Day 6

---

Here's a question I get all the time:

*"Chad, how do you post so much content without burning out?"*

The answer: **I don't create 120 pieces of content.**

I create ONE.

Then my team multiplies it.

Here's how it works:

**Step 1: One 60-minute recording**
I hop on a call. Talk about what I know. Share stories, frameworks, opinions.

**Step 2: Extract the gold**
My team pulls out the best moments — the hooks, the insights, the quotable lines.

**Step 3: Multiply across formats**
That one recording becomes:
- 30 short-form videos (Reels, TikTok, Shorts)
- 30 long-form clips (YouTube, LinkedIn)
- 30 written posts (LinkedIn, Twitter)
- 30 newsletter snippets

**120+ pieces. One hour of my time.**

The hooks you generated? Those are just the starting point. Imagine having a team that writes them FOR you — plus films, edits, and posts everything.

That's what we do at FTS.
