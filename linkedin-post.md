# Hook Generator LinkedIn Post

## Option 1: The Giveaway Angle

I just built a free tool that writes viral hooks for you.

Here's how it works:

1. Enter your topic (fitness, real estate, whatever)
2. Pick your platform
3. Get 10 customized hook templates instantly

No email required for the first 3.

Why am I giving this away?

Because I've seen too many smart people with great ideas get ZERO engagement.

Not because their content is bad.
Because their hooks are invisible.

The first 2 seconds decide everything.

I've generated 70M+ views for clients using these exact formulas.

Now you can use them too.

## Option 2: The Problem Angle

90% of your content is invisible.

Not because it's bad. Because your hooks are weak.

Here's the harsh reality:

→ You have 1-2 seconds to grab attention
→ Most people start with context, not curiosity
→ By the time you get to the good stuff, they're gone

I used to struggle with this too.

Then I studied what actually works. Analyzed thousands of viral posts. Found the patterns.

Now I've turned those patterns into a free tool.

Enter your topic. Get 10 proven hook templates. Customized to YOUR niche.

No gatekeeping. No course. Just the formulas.

## Option 3: The Results Angle

These hooks generated 70M+ views.

Now you can steal them.

I just launched a free Hook Generator that gives you:

✅ 10 customized hook templates for YOUR topic
✅ 7 different hook categories (curiosity, numbers, contrarian, etc.)
✅ Platform-specific tips
✅ A 50+ template swipe file

Why free?

Because hooks are just the starting point.

The real magic happens when you have a team turning those hooks into 120+ pieces of content per month.

That's what we do at FTS.

But everyone deserves better hooks — whether you work with us or not.
